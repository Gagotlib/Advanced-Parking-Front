# Advanced Parking

### Problem

This project arises as a response to the mobility challenges in densely populated areas with an excess of cars in circulation. Finding parking in unexpected situations is a daily difficult task for drivers. Our initiative aims to offer a concrete and secure solution to this problem.

### Solution

With Advanced Parking, users can access our application, register, and start reserving a parking spot at their preferred location and time, minimizing wasted time and frustration when searching for parking.

### Distinction

Our application stands out for being user-friendly, with transparent pricing policies and special promotions to encourage customer loyalty. Additionally, we provide a navigation service that allows users to find the optimal route from their current location to the selected parking spot.

### Strategy

#### User Flow

We created a user flow that defines how to interact with the application and the steps involved in reserving the first parking spot. We based it on a very dynamic structure while minimizing the number of steps involved.

### How It Works:

<p> Simple yet attractive screens that convey the application's value proposition to users.</p>
<p>The following screens are presented to users for:</p>

• Searching for or selecting a nearby parking space and making a reservation.

  </div>

• Registering or logging in and then making the payment.

  </div>

• Upon arrival, head to the property, scan the QR code on your ticket to access, and drive to the selected parking area.

  </div>

• When your reservation ends, rate the service through the web application.

  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; flex-wrap: wrap;">

  </div>

## Conclusion

Creating this application has been a thoroughly rewarding experience for us (with its ups and downs and tedium!). The teamwork, the interest from day one until completion, has marked us with unity and determination to support every area. We do not regret the time invested, the long hours spent extinguishing fires whenever we encountered Error 500 Internal Server.

We learned and discovered something new at each stage of the process. We greatly enjoyed implementing the application in both backend and frontend branches.

Thank you for reading, and we hope you found it interesting!
